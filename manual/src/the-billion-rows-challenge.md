# The Billion Rows Challenge

The [One Billion Rows Challenge](https://1brc.dev/) was put together as a test of programming language skills. It
was originally in Java, and has popped up in just about every language out there. Java tends to win the
contest, the JVM is *really* well optimized for this type of task---but we're not going to let that stop us.

We're Rustaceans, and we like speed.
