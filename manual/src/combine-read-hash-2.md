Here's the results (release mode):

```
File & hash time: 0.130s
Calculate time:   0.006s
Print time:       0.663s
TOTAL:            0.799s
```

So effectively the same speed. With 1 BILLION rows, it actually completes!

```
File & hash time: 115.592s
Calculate time:   1.614s
Print time:       0.802s
TOTAL:            118.008s
```

So at nearly 2 minutes, we're not going to be winning any prizes for speed --- but at least this
version finished!
